### Hi everyone 👋


## 😁 About Me
Hi, I'm Rogelio Ceballos Castillo. Currently I´m studying computer systems and software engineering 
at the Universidad de la Salle Bajío.

## :computer: programming languages
The programming languages I have used are C#, Java and JavaScript. Although I have used all the 
languages mentioned above, I still have a lot to learn to actually use these programming languages 
in more detail.
